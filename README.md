# Data Driven Insights into Delayed Responses to Consumer Grievances in the Banking-Sector

# Introduction 

In today’s competitive banking landscape, customer satisfaction and trust are critical to long-term success. One of the essential components of customer service is the prompt handling of consumer complaints. Recently, XYZ Bank has been facing a significant concern raised by its customers delays in receiving timely responses to their complaints. This growing issue has not only led to dissatisfaction but has also begun to erode the trust between the bank and its valued clients.
Recognizing the seriousness of the problem, the bank’s branch manager has commissioned a detailed data-driven analysis to uncover the underlying causes of these delays. The responsibility was assigned to a data analyst, who was provided with historical complaint records. The dataset includes information such as complaint categories, submission channels, response timelines, and regional details. The objective of this project is to analyze the trends and patterns in delayed responses, identify which factors contribute most to these delays, and ultimately suggest actionable recommendations to improve the bank's complaint resolution process and rebuild customer trust.

# Dataset 

The dataset titled Consumer_Complaints.csv contains 62,516 entries and 12 columns, documenting customer complaints received by the bank. Each row represents a unique complaint identified by a Complaint_ID. The dataset includes various attributes such as:

•	**Submitted via :** Channel through which the complaint was submitted (e.g., Web, Referral).

•	**Date submitted and Date received :** Timelines related to complaint submission and receipt.

•	**Distict :** Geographic district  of the complaint origin.

•	**Complaint category and compaint sub category :** The cateogy of complaint (e.g., Credit card, Mortgage).

•	**Issue and Sub_issue :** Nature of the complaint.

•	**Company response to consumer and Company public response :** The bank's feedback.

•	**Timely response? :** Indicates whether the response was timely.

# Tools

# Overview

This project focuses on addressing delays in responding to consumer complaints within a banking institution. Due to increased customer feedback highlighting untimely responses, trust in the bank’s service has been impacted. The branch manager has initiated a data analysis project to investigate this issue. A dataset containing detailed complaint records—including complaint types, submission methods, issue categories, regional data, and response timeliness—was analyzed to uncover the root causes of delays. The objective is to identify patterns and key factors contributing to poor response performance and to provide actionable recommendations aimed at enhancing the bank's customer complaint resolution process.

# Data Analysis & Decision

The analysis of customer complaint data using Python and Power BI revealed several key factors contributing to delays in complaint response. Through data visualization in Power BI, it was observed that certain complaint types particularly those related to **credit card** and **managing account services** had significantly higher instances of delayed responses. The submission channel also played a critical role; complaints submitted via phone and referral sources showed more delays compared to those submitted through the web.

Regional analysis highlighted specific districts where delays were consistently higher, indicating potential resource or process inefficiencies. Python analysis supported these findings through trend identification and statistical breakdowns of response timelines.

To overcome these issues, the following steps are recommended:

Prioritize high-delay issue types with dedicated handling teams.

Optimize the complaint submission process, promoting efficient channels like the web.

Allocate additional resources or training in underperforming districts.

Implement real-time tracking of complaints and response performance metrics in Power BI for management oversight.

These measures aim to reduce response time, improve operational efficiency, and most importantly, rebuild customer trust in the bank’s complaint resolution system.

# Conclusion

This project successfully identified key factors contributing to delays in customer complaint responses using Python analysis and Power BI visualization. By examining submission methods, issue types, and regional trends, actionable insights were generated. Implementing the recommended strategies can enhance response efficiency, strengthen customer trust, and significantly improve the overall complaint resolution process within the bank.
