# Data Driven Insights into Delayed Responses to Consumer Grievances in the Banking-Sector

# Introduction 

In today’s competitive banking landscape, customer satisfaction and trust are critical to long-term success. One of the essential components of customer service is the prompt handling of consumer complaints. Recently, XYZ Bank has been facing a significant concern raised by its customers delays in receiving timely responses to their complaints. This growing issue has not only led to dissatisfaction but has also begun to erode the trust between the bank and its valued clients.
Recognizing the seriousness of the problem, the bank’s branch manager has commissioned a detailed data-driven analysis to uncover the underlying causes of these delays. The responsibility was assigned to a data analyst, who was provided with historical complaint records. The dataset includes information such as complaint categories, submission channels, response timelines, and regional details. The objective of this project is to analyze the trends and patterns in delayed responses, identify which factors contribute most to these delays, and ultimately suggest actionable recommendations to improve the bank's complaint resolution process and rebuild customer trust.
